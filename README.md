# remoteAccess_COI

This is a guide for accessing with ssh to the servers of the "Centro Oncol√≥gico Integral" (aka COI).
I decided to write it since this is the first time I need to interact with a user from a remote computer, and I had a few problems
understanding how to do it. I hope this guide can be useful for anyone that needs quick advices on how to use ssh and tmux to create
a remote work environment.

I'll make sure to keep uploading this document 
during my 3 months internship at COI developing algorithms of artificial intelligence, adding information that I find
useful along the way :)

Note: This document is written in Spanish, but I hope to also upload an English version once the Spanish one is finished.
